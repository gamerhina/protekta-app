STRUCTURAL RESTORATION REPORT
=============================

Following the reset, the complete folder structure has been recreated in the root `uploads/` directory. 
This structure is fully compatible with both your user-facing file management and the symlink requires for the web server.

CREATED DIRECTORIES:
--------------------
uploads/
├── photos/
│   ├── dosen/
│   ├── mahasiswa/
│   └── admin/
├── documents/
│   ├── seminar/
│   └── surat/
│       ├── attachments/
│       └── generated/
├── signatures/
├── branding/
└── temp/

CONFIGURATION CHECK:
--------------------
1. Base Path: Configured to `base_path('uploads')` in `config/filesystems.php`.
2. Symlink: `public/uploads` is strictly linked to `c:\laragon\www\protekta-apps\uploads`.
3. Database: All paths in the database were previously updated to point to these new locations (e.g. `photos/dosen/...`).

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
You can now start re-uploading your assets (User photos, Logo, etc.) through the application dashboard.
The system is ready to accept and serve them immediately.
